# Rust development environment

As already mentioned, we are going to rely on Docker in order to containerize our applications and our development environments. The PC on which we install Docker and, as a consequence, from where we will build our Docker container images, and from where we will run our Docker containers, will be referred to as *host PC*.

Depending on the host PC's operating system, we need to use slightly different terminal commands, that is why we divide also the readme files:

- [Mac OS](docs/Mac.md)
- [Ubuntu OS](docs/Ubuntu.md)
- [Windows OS](docs/Windows.md)
