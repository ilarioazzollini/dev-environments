# Development on a Windows host PC

The easiest way to get Docker on Windows is by installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Open Docker Desktop in order to get the Docker engine running. If we correctly installed Docker Desktop and the engine is running, we can open a PowerShell and check Docker version by

```powershell
docker --version
```

If we did not get any errors, we can safely proceed.
